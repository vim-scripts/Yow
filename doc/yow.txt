*yow.txt*  Vim port of Emacs's M-x yow feature

Commands:

:Yow
    Displays a Zippy The Pinhead quote.

:YowInfo
    Displays information about the current Yow! install.

                                                               *yow-settings*

The quotes are stored in a file "yow.lines" which should be available in your
runtime path.  This file is taken directly from Emacs.  Quotes are
null-separated and the first quote is just info.
